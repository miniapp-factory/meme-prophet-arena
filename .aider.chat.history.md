```
Code an extremely viral Telegram mini-app for Base chain called "Meme Prophet Arena". Users prompt an OpenXAI to generate prophetic-style memes predicting the next 100x memecoin, price action, or wild crypto events. Users battle predictions in real-time arenas, stake USDC/ETH on Base, vote, and share battles. Winners earn daily airdrops + rare NFT crowns. Login using Coinbase Smart Wallet (one-tap). All staking, rewards, settlements, NFT minting 100% on Base. Deep Coinbase/Farcaster integration: every win, every prophecy, every battle result has a "Cast to Base" button that auto-posts a beautiful frame-style card to Farcaster/Warpcast with embedded replay + referral link. Include one-tap invites to Telegram groups and Farcaster follows. Maximize referral compounding, global + friends leaderboards, real Base yields. UI: dark, meme-heavy, addictive. Go all-out, no limits to dominate the leaderboard.
```
